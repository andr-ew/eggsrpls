# eggsrpls

eggs + rpls

if you feel like understanding this script you have to read about the two other scripts which together make up this script

https://github.com/andr-ew/eggs

https://github.com/andr-ew/rpls

you'll need a grid. the bottom row of the grid controls rpls, as described in the rpls documentation, rows above control eggs, same as standalone eggs.

I'll add more info someday. weeeeeeee
